Getting started
---------------

Welcome, weary traveler, to Digichem!

This getting started guide is designed to teach you the basics of the Digichem platform. If you've never used the program before
(or it's just been a while and you need a refresh), then you've come to the right place! In this guide, we'll be covering 
the entire process of submitting your first calculation, from downloading the program all the way through to analysing the data.
This guide will be exclusively using the :ref:`GUI <interface_gui>`, which is the main way of using the program that we
recommend for new users.

The guides have been designed with the intention that you progress through them in order, but of course feel free to refer back to a particular section 
for future reference if you need.
