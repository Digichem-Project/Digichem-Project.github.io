Mac OS versions
---------------

The MacOS versions of Digichem are offered in two flavours. This is because there are two different version of MacOS, depending on whether
your Mac uses an older intel CPU, or a newer `Apple Silicon CPU <https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943>`_. You should download the version of Digichem that matches your MacOS, otherwise
things won't work properly. Use this quick guide to work out which version you need:

* If your machine is newer than 2023, you almost certainly want the `normal Mac download <https://digi-chem.co.uk/hubfs/Builds/Digichem-latest-arm64-mac.zip>`_.
* If your machine is older than 2020, you almost certainly want the `legacy Mac download <https://digi-chem.co.uk/hubfs/Builds/Digichem-latest-mac.zip>`_.
* If your machine is between these two dates, or you just want to double check, then open the 'About This Mac' window from the main Apple menu.
  Your processor type is listed under the **Chip** heading:

  #. If your chip is listed as **Apple M1**, **Apple M2** or similar, then you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and should use the `normal Mac download <https://digi-chem.co.uk/hubfs/Builds/Digichem-latest-arm64-mac.zip>`_.
  #. If your chip is listed as **Intel**, then you have an older Intel Mac, and should use  the `legacy Mac download <https://digi-chem.co.uk/hubfs/Builds/Digichem-latest-mac.zip>`_.
