Once the calculation has finished, we will need some way at looking at the results!

The PDF report
--------------

The quickest way to view the completed data is to click the corresponding calculation row in the **Completed** jobs panel:

This will open the calculation report, a preformatted PDF file that contains all of the critical calculation results:

This report that we have opened is for the geometry optimisation of Benzene. It can tell us such information as:

Calculation metadata

The total energy of the molecule
================================

Molecular orbital information
=============================

Including orbital density plots:

And much more besides.

An excited states report
------------------------

However, we've already agreed that the optimisation of Benzene is not so interesting. More interesting, perhaps,
is the excited states of Pyridine:

This report contains additional calculation results, namely:

Excited states data
===================

Including a graph of the calculated states:

And a table of all the states calculated:
