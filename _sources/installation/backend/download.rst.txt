========

Digichem is distributed in binary form only; no source-code for the main program is available (but the core library is `open-source <https://github.com/Digichem-Project/digichem-core>`_).

These builds are automatically compiled by Build-boy, the Digichem build server.
Build-boy creates builds for the most popular versions of Linux that are used by computational servers.
Currently, this includes Fedora-like distros (CentOS/Redhat *etc.*) from version 7 to 9, and Debian like distros
from 8 (Jessie) to 12 (bookworm). CentOS 6, sadly, is too old to be supported. If you cluster still uses CentOS/Redhat 6, please consider
upgrading.

If your cluster does not use a supported distro, please try the ``CentOS-7.9`` build in the first instance,
as it is the most widely supported version. We also welcome you to request support for your favourite flavour of Linux
by creating an issue for `Build-boy <https://github.com/Digichem-Project/build-boy/issues>`__.


What OS do I have?
------------------

Login to your cluster and execute the following command to determine your operating system version:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cat /etc/*elease
    
On Redhat-7.9 for example, you'll see the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server"
    VERSION="7.9 (Maipo)"
    ID="rhel"
