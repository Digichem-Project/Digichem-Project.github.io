Installing the backend
==================================

This section of the documentation covers how to install the Digichem backend.

.. important::
   The backend is normally installed automatically by the GUI. You do not need to follow these instructions if you have already followed
   the :ref:`getting started guide <get_started_install>`.

   These instructions are intended only for advanced users and system administrators who are looking to install the Digichem backend manually.
   

.. note::
   This installation only covers the main Digichem program. If you are looking to (also) install the open-source Digichem-core library, please see the separate documentation `here <https://github.com/Digichem-Project/digichem-core>`_.

Dependencies
____________

Digichem is distributed as a fully self-contained binary, which means it has no required dependencies to run.
However, Digichem uses an external rendering engine to generate orbital plots and other 3D renders.
If you would like to generate these types of images, you should make sure Visual Molecular Dynamics
(:ref:`VMD <vmd_requirement>`) is installed on your cluster before you begin to install Digichem.

.. note::
   Many computational clusters already have VMD installed, make sure to check your cluster's documentation first before you try and install it yourself!

Quick installation instructions
_______________________________

Installing Digichem is easy:

 #. Download the latest version of Digichem from the `automated build server <https://github.com/Digichem-Project/build-boy>`_
 #. Upload the archive to your computational cluster
 #. Unzip the archive with ``tar -xzf digichem.*.tar.gz``
 #. Run the install script with ``digichem/_internal/install.sh``
 #. If you've not used Digichem on this server before, run the setup program with ``digichem setup``

And that's it! Next, you'll want to let Digichem know which submission queues and calculation engines are :ref:`available <setup>`, and then you can begin submitting calculations.
